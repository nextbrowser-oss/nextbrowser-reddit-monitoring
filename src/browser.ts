// The browser surface the monitor needs.
//
// It is a subset of the X reply engine's XBrowser in nextbrowser-app
// (src/lib/xreply/browser.ts), so the app can hand the monitor the same
// nextctl-backed browser it already builds for a prepared profile. Outside the
// app, src/node/nbc.ts implements it over the nbc CLI.
//
// Reddit is read through its own JSON endpoints, fetched from a reddit.com tab
// with the profile's cookies, so the monitor needs no clicks, no scrolling and
// no waiting for elements: a tab on the site and a way to evaluate a script.
//
// Nothing here may depend on Node: the app runs its engines in the renderer.
